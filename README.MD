## Personal Projects on GitHub

I'm new in the Git world and decide make a project to introduce myself in these tolls.

First of all I made a documentation of how I configure my Linux Ubuntu to use Git, Python, PyCharm e Jupyter.

This environment will be used in Data Science studies.

After that I will configure my account in AWS by code for use features like S3, lambda/EMR, Step Functions and SageMake.

This environment will be used in projects of data engineering.
