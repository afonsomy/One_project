The environment is make for que python library and Git Hub project.

Changing standard shell to z...

Well everybody say that zsh is the better shell to use together Git and Python. I'm starting to use too.

As a pre-requisite, ensure that the following tools are installed; git, wget, curl

> sudo apt-get install wget curl git

Installing zsh:
> sudo apt install zsh

Check installation:
> zsh --version
zsh 5.4.2 (x86_64-ubuntu-linux-gnu)

Configure zsh:
> chsh -s $(which zsh

Install Oh-my-zsh:
> sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"

Configure Oh-my-zsh:

The main configuration file for Zsh is located under $HOME/.zshrc while the Oh-my-Zsh configuration files are located under $HOME/.oh-my-zsh/ directory.

If more details is necessary I can make a search in Google webpages like:
