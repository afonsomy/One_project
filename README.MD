#### 2. Changing standard shell to z...

Well everybody say that zsh is the better shell to use together Git and Python. I'm starting to use too.

As a pre-requisite, ensure that the following tools are installed; git, wget, curl

> sudo apt-get install wget curl git

Installing zsh:
> sudo apt install zsh

Check installation:
> zsh --version
zsh 5.4.2 (x86_64-ubuntu-linux-gnu)

Configure zsh:
> chsh -s $(which zsh

Install Oh-my-zsh:
> sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"

Configure Oh-my-zsh:

The main configuration file for Zsh is located under $HOME/.zshrc while the Oh-my-Zsh configuration files are located under $HOME/.oh-my-zsh/ directory.

If more details is necessary I can make a search in Google webpages like:
