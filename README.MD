## Personal Projects on GitHub

I'm new in the Git world and decide make a project to introduce myself in these tolls.

First of all I made a documentation of how I configure my Linux Ubuntu to use Git, Python, PyCharm e Jupyter.
This environment will be used in Data Science studies.

After that I will configure my account in AWS by code for use features like S3, lambda/EMR, Step Functions and SageMake.
This environment will be used in projects of data engineering.

The most important thing is that I will have a step by step documentation of how rebirth my environment to Big Data and Machine Learning stuffs in any machine that I will use in the future.
